## Logistic Regression using Neural Networks

This repository demonstrates how to build a Logistic Regression algorithm using a Neural Networks mindset. It shows how to use the concepts of Neural Networks, such as gradient descent and backpropagation, to solve a Logistic Regression problem. The code and resources provided in this repository can serve as a starting point for further experimentation and research.
